# Welcome to my Niko's Page!

here you will find my first steps as learning and greenhorn web-developer. 


Me, Niko loves art, nature...

- gardening
- meditation
- herblism
- psychology..

  .. right now I just have been starting with a Web Development part-time training at NeueFische.
Hopefully I can find a new career path or get some inspiration for life in general.

Enjoy this site even if its still mostly empty and enjoy life and yourself!
