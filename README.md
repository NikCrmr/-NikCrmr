#  :hibiscus: Welcome to Niko's GitHub! :cherry_blossom:

here starts my journey as a learning-greenhorn web-developer.

  .. right now I just have been starting with a Web Development part-time training at NeueFische.
Hopefully I can find a new career path or get some inspiration for life in general.

Enjoy this site even if its still mostly empty and enjoy life and yourself!
