#  :hibiscus: Welcome to Niko's GitHub! :cherry_blossom:

here you will find my first steps as learning and greenhorn web-developer. 


Me, Niko loves art, nature...

- :seedling: gardening
- :pray: meditation  
- :herb: herblism
- :thought_balloon: psychology..

  .. right now I just have been starting with a Web Development part-time training at NeueFische.
Hopefully I can find a new career path or get some inspiration for life in general.

Enjoy this site even if its still mostly empty and enjoy life and yourself!
